Thank you for buying my 2000s Retro Racing Game Music Pack! 

All tracks in the LOOPS folder can be looped from beginning to end, and any song at a bpm of 128bpm can be looped at 
15sec, 30sec, and 1min intervals depending on your needs. The track "Sideswiped" can also be looped from the 1min mark until the end. 
(I included the bpm in the file names to make it easier.)

I also included full versions of all the tracks with endings if needed in the FULL SONGS folder.

I hope that you find these tracks fit perfectly into your project. Purchasing a license is not required. You are free to use these 
tracks in your commercial project in any way.  

Please let me know how you used the music - I'd be happy to play your game and share/promote it!
